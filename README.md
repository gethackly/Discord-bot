# Discord-bot's Readme

## **Overview**  
The purpose of this wiki is to guide you through contributing to the development and improvement of HacklyBot, all while ensuring the security of sensitive data such as API tokens and bot activity.  

### **Why**  
The goal is to foster collaborative creation in a public space. Share your ideas, discuss your technical challenges, and avoid working in isolationâ€”this is a group effort! Keep comments concise and not overly technical to encourage collaboration and creativity.  

### **What**  
We aim to build HacklyBot together. Youâ€™ll start with a shared base code available on GitHub, which everyone can access and modify. Share your progress, ideas, and challenges openly with the group. If you create something great, weâ€™ll merge your contributions into the main botâ€™s code.  

### **How**  
Weâ€™ve created a dedicated test server where you can:  
- Create and test your own bot.  
- Collaborate with others and share feedback.  
- See and learn from the work of others.  
When you make changes, explain your ideas in the chat, share your updated code with the group, and work together to refine the bot.  

# **Tutorial: Add and Host Your Bot on the Test Server**

## **Step 1: Join the Test Server**
