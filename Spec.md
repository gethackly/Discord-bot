# 2️⃣ Pseudocode the Features
Together, we’ll break down each feature into simple steps (logic written in plain English).

# 3️⃣ Break into Tasks
From the pseudocode, we’ll create small coding tasks so anyone can pick one and start contributing.

---

# 4️⃣ Code the Bot
Once each code piece is done, we will have to bring everything together.

# 5️⃣ Test and Improve
Once it’s ready, we’ll test, fix bugs, and keep adding cool features!
